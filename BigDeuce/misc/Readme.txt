RULES OF THE GAME 

A deck of cards is distributed to four players. The player with the 3 of diamond will play
first and it has to be included in the first play. Each player can play either 1, 2 or 5
cards. The next player must put something higher than the previous play with the same number
of cards from the previous play. If a player decided not to play, he can pass his turn. If 
all three players pass their turns, the player with the last play will start a new round 
with anything he chooses. 

The ranking of cards in ascending order is 3, 4, ... A, 2. The ranking of suits in ascending
order is diamond, club, heart, spade. In other words, 2 of spade is the highest card and 3 
of diamond the lowest card. Two or three cards play must be of the same rank. The rank of a
pair is determined by the rank, i.e. 2 pair is higher than Ace pair which is higher than 
King pair. When the ranks are the same, the pair with the spade is higher, e.g. 10 spade, 
10 diamond pair is higher than 10 heart, 10 club pair. Similarly, the rank of threes is 
determined by the rank of the cards, i.e. threes of 2 is higher than threes of Ace which is
higher than threes of King, etc. 

The ranking for five cards play in ascending order is straight, flush, full house, 
four of a kind, straight flush.

e.g. 34567, 9TJQK. Lowest of the all types. 
Highest straight is TJQKA and lowest is A2345 followed by 23456. 
Within straight, ranking is first determined by rank then by suit, 
e.g. 45678 is higher than 34567 & 3456(7spade) is higher than 3456(7heart). 


Flush Five cards having the same suit, 
e.g. 3589J of club, 479TK of heart. Higher than straight only. 
Within flush, ranking is determined by the rank of the highest card, 
e.g. 689TK of diamond is higher than 79TJQ of spade. 


Full House Consist of a pair and a threes, 
e.g. 33888, 99KKK Higher than flush and straight only. 
Within full house, ranking is determined by the rank of the threes, 
e.g. 33888 is higher than 99777. 

Four of a kind Consist of four cards of the same rank and any other card, 
e.g. 44443, 7777K. Lower than straight flush only.
